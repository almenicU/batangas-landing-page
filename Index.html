	<h1>HISTORY OF BATANGAS</h1>
	<p>Batangas (Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Batangas), (Spanish: Provincia de Batangas), is a first class province of the Philippines located on the southwestern part of Luzon in the CALABARZON region. Its capital is Batangas City and it is bordered by the provinces of Cavite and Laguna to the north and Quezon to the east. Across the Verde Island Passages to the south is the island of Mindoro and to the west lies the South China Sea. Poetically, Batangas is often referred to by its ancient name Kumintang.

	Batangas is one of the most popular tourist destinations near Metro Manila. The province has many beaches and is famous for excellent diving spots including Anilao in Mabini, Sombrero Island in Tingloy, Ligpo Island in Bauan, these areas more popularly known as Anilao. Matabungkay in Lian, Punta Fuego in Nasugbu, Calatagan and Laiya in San Juan.

	Batangas is also where Taal Volcano, one of the Decade Volcanoes is located. It is also where the Taal Heritage town lies, a small picturesque town that has ancestral houses and structures dating back to the 19th century.

	Batangas has the second largest international seaport in the Philippines after Metro Manila. The identification of the city as an industrial growth center in the region and being the focal point of the CALABARZON program resulted to the increasing number of business establishments in the city’s Central Business District (CBD) as well as numerous industries operating at the province’s industrial parks.<br>


<h3>Etymology</h3>

	The first recorded name of the Province was Kumintang, after the Datu who inherited the dominion from Datu Balensusa. Its centre, the present day Balayan, was the most progressive town of the Province and the traditional centre of governance. Later, as the eruption of the Taal Volcano destroyed a significant portion of the town, the provincial centre was transferred toTaal, which was then called Bonbon and the name of the province was changed after that of the town.

	The term batangan means a raft, the people used so that they could fish in the nearby Taal Lake. It also meant the numerous logs found in the Calumpang River, the body of water that runs through the northeastern portion of the town and assumes the shape of a tuning fork.

<h3>People</h3>

	The dialect of Tagalog spoken in the province closely resembles the Old Tagalog spoken before the arrival of the Spanish. Hence the Summer Institute of Linguistics called this province the Heartland of the Tagalog Language. A strong presence of the Tagalog culture is clearly visible to the present day.

	Linguistically Batangueños are also known for their unique affectation of often placing the particles eh or ga (equivalent of particle ba Filipino), usually as a marker of stress on the sentence, at the end of their spoken sentences or speech; for example: “Ay, oo, eh!” (“Aye, yes, indeed!”). Some even prolong the particle ‘eh’ into ‘ala eh’, though it really has no meaning in itself.

	In the recent years, waves of migration from the Visayas had brought significant number of Visayans to 	the province. There are also a few who can speak Spanish, since Batangas was an important centre during the colonial period.

	Batangas also has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 96.5%, wherein the males have a slightly higher literacy rate at 97.1% than females with 95.9%.Combined average of literacy is 96%.

	<p><h1> ECONOMY OF BATANGAS CITY</h1>  The provincial government of Batangas has identified several key industries which, if properly cultivated and developed, have the potential to propel the local economy to unprecedented heights.

	In an interview on Monday, Governor Hermilando Mandanas said his administration will focus on growing the tourism, commercial fishing, logistics services, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors in the next few years.

	Mandanas said efforts are underway to further capitalize on Batangas’ rich history and natural resources to grow the tourism industry and other tourism-related businesses.

	He said the Verde Island Passage (VIP), Taal Volcano and the Taal Basilica are the province’s star attractions.

	“We have the best marine life found in the VIP and we are proud that we have the world-renowned Taal Volcano, as well as the largest church in Asia, the Taal Basilica,” he added.

	Mandanas said partnerships recently forged with the private sector put the province in a good position to entice these businesses and support their operations.

	“We are the most powerful province in terms of the size of our power plants. We are the gateway of our nautical highway and agro-industrial [companies]… we are also recognized as the Asean logistics hub,” he said.

	Mandanas said he recently met with representatives of the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority to discuss the construction of a regional food terminal in the province.

	The provincial government has also strengthened its investment strategy, planning and information technology to help increase the economic growth during the first Batangas Local Economic Development and Investment Promotions (LEDIPO) Conference last week.

	Meanwhile, the “Paskong Batangueño sa Kapitolyo” (Batangueño-style Christmas at the Capitol), which was launched on Saturday, signals an attempt to capture a bigger portion of the country's holiday tourism market.

	As part of the holiday activities at the capitol, the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPAg) is holding the “Barakahan sa Kapitolyo” (Camaraderie at the Capitol), a month-long community market and food park to support local producers, farmers and fisherfolk. (PNA)</p>
